<h1>Neuralink in Society</h1>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>Welcome to my website. This website we will be explaining and discussing Neuralink in society.
</div>
		<br><br>
		
<div class="text_box">
	[Breif intro] Elon Musk's Neuralink is a small chip which will be embedded in the human brain. This technology will allow people that aren't able to use or move certain parts of their body, the ability to do so. This is not fiction, but it is the near future that we come to. This could potentially expand in which another person that possess a Neuralink be able to communicate with one and the other. On the other hand, to gift people with enchaning skills and abilities.</p>

</ul><p>While infected computers can do significant damage, if all else fails, we usually have the option 
		of turning them off or closing the window. If a chip implanted in your skull is infected withÂ a 
		virus that keeps moving a limb, it will be difficult to turn off. There are many more sinister 
		actions someone could cause to another human. Therefore, most people are skeptical about Neuralink 
        and how it works. I believe that if they want to develop this into a greater objective, they must 
        show how safe you will be with it. </p>
