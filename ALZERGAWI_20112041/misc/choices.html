	</ul><h4><p>Why Neuralink?</p></h4>

	</ul><p>The reason I chose Neuralink is because of the limitless possibilities that it offers. Infinite
		diseases and disorders could be cured, benefiting millions of individuals all over the world. This is 
		what motivates me to study more about Neuralink and to try to educate others about it. I understand 
		that most individuals are apprehensive about having a chip put in their skull, and that is 
		completely understandable. As a result, I'm hoping to make a change on this website.

	<p>The Neuralink team is now testing and implanting the Nerualink in animals, with some success in 
	pigs and a chimpanzee. They were able to record various signals for various events that occurred with 
	these animals, such as eating, loud noises, tough tasks, and so on. Then they were able to figure out what 
	the various signals meant and how they might alter them to make the animal happy or upset. Elon Musk has 
	stated that for the time being, the Neuralink will only be utilised for medical purposes in human trials, 
	but that soon, he plans to spread this to everyday life.
