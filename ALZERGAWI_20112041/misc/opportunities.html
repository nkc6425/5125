</div>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>Neuralink can be utilised to cure neuro-degenerative disorders like Alzheimer's, Huntington's,
		and Parkinson's in the not-too-distant future. Imagine an elderly person being able to stay sharp 
		and be present for decades longer, rather than having their mental faculties degraded by age.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>This is one of Elon Musk's and his team's early stages in developing Neuralink. Their first objective 
		is to put this equipment in place so that it can treat and assist people with the disorders indicated
		in the previous paragraph. The way they want to do this is by surgically inserting a chip/gadget called 
		the link into the client's skull by a neurosurgeon. In this procedure, several wires are connected to 
		the electrodes (Renuka K, 2020). If a person has a repeated seizure, the link is able to return the 
		opposite single, cancelling the seizures. This could exoculate to provide the client enhanced ability 
		in specific body areas, such as increased vision, hearing, or body motions.

	<p>To make things clearer, there are two separate electrodes that we'll refer to as electrode 1 and 
		electrode 2. The first electrode will be put on the neuron's right side. This will be capable of 
		detecting any electrical field produced by neurone firing. Then electrode 2 enters the picture. 
		Electrode 2 will be placed far away to determine if it can still detect neurone firing, and if it can, 
		it will go even further away until it can no longer detect it. This distance is about 60 nanometers, 
		however it varies from person to person (Kenny L, 2019). These are the electrodes that will be in charge
		of transmitting opposite signals in order to reverse certain illnesses or regain particular abilities.

	</ul><h4><p>Future of Neuralink</p></h4>
</div>	

<div class="text_box">
	<p>The future of Neuralink is what I like to say the microcosm of the future macrocosm of technology.  
		What I mean is that Neuralink could serve as a new entry point into the technological revolution. 
		The new social construct. What would you see if we were to see 20 years into the future? Humans 
		conquering another planet, robots strolling about like civilians, or cutting-edge technology that 
		may cure diseases and problems. Because this is my forecast for the next 20 years. With the 
		advancement of technology, it only seems fair that we take this step to aid the sick. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>Elon Musk and the team behind Neuorlink are currently wanting to further explained there testing 
		on monkeys and apes. This will help their studies to develop the Neuralink into a tech which will be 
		stabile for humans. Implant animals with neural-brain connections that allow them to manipulate items
		on display have already been done. So, their initial application is improved mental control for a 
		robotic arm for someone who is paralyzed. The business has also hinted that the chip's initial 
		real-world application will be to allow quadriplegics to manage their phones and laptops. 
		Indicated on the Joe Rogan podcast, Elon Musk has said that human testing could begin by the end of 
		this year (Isobel A. H, 2021). Neuralink has been testing animals for signals and monitoring how the 
		neurons react to each occurrence, such as a pig providing a strong signal when food are supplied or a 
		ape completing a problem . This is good news since it can record any negative reactions to such 
		occurrences so it will be able to detect and counterattack them in the future. They will move on to 
		implanting the Neuralink into animals with disorders to see how they will be able to send certain 
		neurons and signals to recover and eliminate their disorders once they have completed basic trials. 
		This is only the beginning for Neuralink, as they have announced the release of their first version of 
		Neuralink, dubbed N1.

	</ul><h4><p>My opinion over the future of Neuralink</p></h4>
</div>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>My overall impression of Neuralink is that it is the technology of the future. A completely 
		different approach to assisting disabled individuals. Because humans have made such a significant 
		contribution to evolution, it only seems natural that a cutting-edge technology will be developed 
		sooner or later. I wish to live in a future where diseases and disorders are never feared, and where 
		those abilities may be restored. Where everybody has the same skill level as the person next to them. 
		Of course, there are a few things I'm looking forwards to in the near future. However, as previously 
		stated, "Neurolink is a microcosm of the future macrocosm of technology." This is simply the beginning 
		of Neuralink's development; much more testing is required to ensure a brighter future. So, for the time 
		being, I'll take each day as it comes until I hear of a chip that can fix human disabilities.
