	</ul><h4><p>Introduction to risks of Neuralink</p></h4>
</div>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>It's natural to be concerned about the possibility of having a computer in your head that controls 
		or records your every move. On this page, I'll go through these concerns in greater detail, as well 
		as what they potentially mean for Neuralink's future and my general thoughts on them.

	</ul><h4><p>Threats to Neuralink</p></h4>
</div>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>Because the risks of neuralink are so high, every vulnerability must be evaluated, regardless of its 
		size. This could range from the actual chip to the software and the device's internal workings. Because,
		at the end of the day, the last thing a huge I.T business wants is for a chip in someone's head to be 
		hacked, increasing the risk of death. As a result, I'll go over what I think to be the most significant 
		threats to Neuralink. 
	</p>

<div class="text_box">
	</ul><h5><p>Hacking</p></h5>
</div>

<div class="text_box">
	<p>One of the most obvious concerns to neuralink is the possibility of the chip being hacked by an 
		individual or group. In today's world, no system is truly "unhackable," but it is extremely difficult
		to make one appear to be "unhackable.", such as google or apple. While researching, I came across 
		an intriguing connection between someone hacking Nerualink and Christopher Nolan's 2010 film 
		Inception. They say, having the ability to hack an individual's mind to get confidential information
		to blackmail the person or make the individual do something they wouldn’t do otherwise, this could 
		potentially happen if someone hacked the chip (Jennifer S, 2020). This really opens my mind to the 
		possibility of getting hacked while having the Neuralink. In Inception, a group of people go through
		someone's dreams to get some confidential information but take that same concept but change the 
		group to malware or a virus.
	</p>
	<p>This is where we'll talk about malware and what it might mean. When we think of malware or a virus 
		these days, we usually think of a compromised laptop, computer, or server with several problems, bugs, 
		and windows opening and slowing down or stealing data. Now lets take, for example, a virus that plays 
		music for 10 minutes. On a computer, this is acceptable since you can close it, mute it, or turn off 
		your computer; however, if this happened with a nerualink, you wouldn't be able to close it, mute it, 
		or turn it off. While investigating, I came across this concept and thought it was an excellent example.
		They use Rick Astly's "Never Gonna Give You Up," a well-known song that is frequently used to troll 
		individuals. They take this harmless music and implant this harmless joke into someone with a Nerualink,
		they will have a song stuck in their heads that they can't turn off. We've gone from a silly joke to a 
		potentially dangerous joke (Jennifer S, 2020). This simply demonstrates how much more sensitive the 
		Nerualink will be to any type of malware or virus.

	</ul><h5><p>Abuse and Privillage</p></h5>

	<p>As previously said, the Neuralink is a gadget that will assist people who are disabled to regain 
		their abilities and to further improving their it. So, could someone use the neuralink to improve their 
		abilities for self-beneficial actions? If Neuralink is made available to the general public, I believe 
		that it will make a normal person physically and mentally better than they were before the implant. Now,
		how does this vary from someone who uses performance-enhancing drugs or adderall and ritalin to 
		increase their physical and mental abilities? Onezero's Andrew Maynard provides an excellent example, 
		explaining, if the Neuralink was truly able to substantially enchance what a person can achieve, are we 
		in danger of creating a two-teir society where people that have Neurolink are able to get better jobs 
		and earn more money, compared too a poor person which dosent have the Neurolink (Andrew M, 2019). This is
		exactly what I'm trying to show you, where the Neuralink can transform an average person with average 
		intelligence into someone who can perform tasks that only people who have spent years learning can 
		perform. This might create yet another societal split, with people who have Neuralink being treated 
		better than others who have not.

	</ul><h5><p>Government</p></h5>

	<p>The government wouldn’t be a surprise to be added as a risk to Neuralink, mostly talking about the 
		United States of America, as Neuralink is currently being tested and built there. United States have a 
		large history of government manipulation, government unlawful spying, and this is what we only know. 
		Therefore, if the government was to get their hand on the Neurolink this could possibly be used for 
		unlawful actions against civilians to get them back in line. I do understand this is an extreme, but, 
		United States have a reputation in which to have large amount of power over people, as they spend close 
		to 60 billion dollars on their Military.

<div class="text_box">
	</ul><h5><p>My opinion about the risks</p></h5>

	<p>My overall opinion regarding the risks that Neuralink could bring is, they will need to further test 
	the chip to ensure the security is nearly flawless and to prove to society it is something which can 
	really help this unfortunate. This is because trying to prove to people that getting a chip in your 
	head will help you with your disabilities would be very hard to persuade them, but if they were able to 
	prove that the security is near to flawless, then this will allow people to further trust the chip. 
	Another opinion I would like to bring up is that the Neuralink show only be implanted to people with 
	disabilities which it will help them. As explained, implanting a chip that enhances a normal person is 
	not ideal as it could be a split to society, so if we only limit the people allowed to get the Nerualink
	to those with disabilities, this would be ideal.
