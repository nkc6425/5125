	</ul><h5><p>Personal Reflection</p></h5>
 
	<p>Making a website on my own was a really interesting and a challenging experience. I've been in a 
	position when I've wanted to stop and give up because of stress. As the person I am, I never gave up and 
	pushed through to the end, but not with a minimum of work, but with the greatest possible standards. Now, 
	at this time and date of 03/10/21, I am close to finishing the website and have made my final presentation, 
	which I will give on them on 15/10/21. 
	</p>
	
	<p>I am quite confident about submitting my work on October 13th, with a few more edits, because I have 
	studied the website and pages and confirmed that I utilised the criteria to evaluate my work. I also 
	modified the structure of the website, as well as the pictures and colours. 
	</p>

	</ul><h5><p>Working alone</p></h5>
	
	<p>At first look, working on a website by yourself while it is intended to have three people sounds 
	like a nightmare and puts you at a disadvantage. That's what I thought at first when I realised I'd be 
	working with myself. Now that I've worked alone, I'm pleased I did because it taught me that if I set 
	my mind to it, I can do almost anything. I developed this website that I am really pleased with after 
	many late nights and endless hours of work. When I say all of this, I don't want to come out as petty, 
	but I'm glad I was able to work with myself because it has broadened my horizons in terms of what I can 
	do.

	</ul><h5><p>Challenges</p></h5>

	<p>Lack of members, workload, and research were among the obstacles I faced. As I indicated in 
	"Working Alone," there were numerous times when I needed assistance but could only rely on myself to 
	accomplish so. The workload, aside from the lack of members, was the implementation of the website; 
	I had to spend several hours ensuring the website met the highest standards, which included modifying 
	and relocating text and graphics to make it more intelligible. As a result, I found myself doing more 
	work, so I'll have to be more disciplined and organised in the future. It was also tough to conduct 
	research because many websites mention Neuroalink.

<div class="text_box">
	</ul><h5><p>Website</p></h5>

	<p>I wanted to make a website that was simple but interesting to look at as I was building it. As a 
	result, I've chosen vivid and inviting colours to convey warmth and comfort on the website, encouraging 
	visitors to read. I then proceeded to build text boxes, which will make reading much simpler while also 
	improving the website's appearance.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="text_box">
	</ul><h5><p>Ethics</p></h5>

	<p>I ensured that the images and the reference was all with APA 7th standards, and the images was for 
	Commercial & other licenses so I wont break any copyright issues.
