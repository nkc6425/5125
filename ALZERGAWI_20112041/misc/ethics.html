	<b>Ali Alzergawi's ethical reflection</b>

	<p> Neuralink is quite enervative, futuristic, and unique, the ability in which taking a chip smaller than 
	your pupils and implanting it in your brain which can send signals to areas that you weren't able to function
	, such as blindness and disability that will also fully restore and enhance those areas as well, like having
	better vision or hearing. This technology does cease to amaze me and what the future of technology beholds.
	But with every good, there is an equal or greater bad side. There is no surprise to say that having a chip 
	implanted in your brain will most likely get you worried about the possibility of it not working, failing, 
	or worse, getting hacked. Nonetheless, if we were to say in a hypothetical standpoint that the flaws 
	mentioned weren't a risk and you would be one hundred percent safe with one, this will arise other problems
	which are abuse and the privilege this comes with. It will come to no surprise that humans abuse something 
	to grant them to be better than others. We know that Neuralink gives the user enhance abilities, this means
	if in the hands of a person that is wanting to gain better physical and or mental abilities over others, 
	how can we differentiate between this and drugs that do the exact same. I have come to find that there is 
	no difference between them but the fact that they both can be used to have a higher advantage over others. 
	This is only a support to another matter which is privilege. As I have mentioned, this would not be the 
	first risk you would think of but it's one of the biggest risks. If we can have abilities that make use 
	abnormally better, could this create a two their society that people that have the Neuralink embedded in 
	their brain to earn more and to have better jobs, on the hand people that don't will have less to earn. 
	</p>
	<p>I really believe, if Neuralink wants to proceed in with making this chip, they will need to ensure that 
	the safety of the user is like Fort Knox. Where the last thing the user will think about is the potential 
	of being hacked or chip malfunction. I also believe that this chip should remain to be only for people who 
	are disabled or paraplegic. This will keep it in the hands of people that want it for their own advantage 
	and be a miracle for people that want to live again.
